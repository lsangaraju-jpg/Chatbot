Chatbot Enhancement Project
This project contains code and documentation to build and enhance a chatbot using Google Colab. The chatbot is designed to improve response efficiency and user interaction by integrating advanced NLP techniques.

Files in the Repository
Building a chatbot.ipynb: This is a Jupyter Notebook containing the initial chatbot code. It includes code cells that demonstrate how to build a basic chatbot using Python.

chatbot.txt: This file contains information and background related to data science. It can be used as part of the chatbot's knowledge base or for testing text processing.
